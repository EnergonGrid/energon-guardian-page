    <p>
      Not everyone finds the path.<br />
      Not because it is hidden —<br />
      but because it is not sought.
    </p>

    <p>
      What you see on the surface is sufficient for most.<br />
      It is calm. It is complete. It asks nothing of you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Access is not granted through arrival.<br />
      It is earned through attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      Those who look only at what is presented<br />
      will never encounter what lies beneath it.
    </p>

      The Grid does not exclude.<br />
      It simply responds.
